Class: WardrobeGUI
Methods: __init__, UpdateWidgets, LoadWardrobeFile
Description:
This object inherits from kivy's ScrollView type. It is pre-loaded with several
GUI elements and file loading logic which allow it to fill the user's screen
with the contents of their wardrobe. The user can scroll up and down.
This object can be used anytime the user's wardrobe needs to be displayed.
Further functionality and GUI elements can easily be added to it by
simply expanding this class.
